Welcome to this **LLM Playground**!ðŸ‘‹ This app lets you to explore and experiment with a variety of language models using the [ellmer package](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/).

It can be used to empower domain experts to write their own prompts and interact with your models without needing to write code. Users can select from the different providers and models available in the ellmer package, define optional API arguments, and customize their prompts to suit their needs. Developers can then use this info help inform their own LLM application or pipeline development.

This message won't be provided to or processed by the model, so you can safely ignore it.
